Honestly, I am a little skeptical about this blogging thing. And I guess if we're being completely honest, I am still skeptical about the Learn.co thing, the career change thing, the certainty of finding a job post-program thing. There's currently a lot in my life that holds a lot of doubt and I'm not really sure how to address any of it. 

The program is tough. I'm not a natural programmer, I'm not a naturally gifted individual, I'm not extremely hard-working either. That's a winning combination. I've been stumped by the beginner Ruby programming more than I've understood it. I've probably asked for help on more than 3/4's of all the labs. I just don't really know if I've absorbing much. How am I going to have a future in programming? 

**Why did you decide to learn software development?**

I went into college knowing absolutely nothing about what I wanted to do career-wise. I hastily chose a degree I thought would suit me, International Relations. I was incredibly intrigued by learning international affairs whether it was economics, politics, culture, conflict, etc. I learned quickly that the major was not exactly what I intended but with every single unit of a course costing thousands of dollars, I didn't really have the luxury of choosing an alternate route. 

In the fall of 2016, I stumbled upon a Data Analysis course for International Relations. The course actually wasn't what I signed up for, but I stayed because it fit my last few requirements and my schedule. The professor was a soft-spoken graduate from NYU, with a clear passion for programming and international relations. We used R Studio to analyze political and demographic data and I thought - this is it. This is what I want to do. It was interesting and necessary knowledge, it took my major and made it into something that wasn't necessarily politics - a branch that I did not want to go into following the elections of 2016. 

Following this class, the professor allowed me to do research for him and I also took a course in Web Design using HTML/CSS and Java which I greatly enjoyed. I decided to bite the bullet and apply for this program because while expensive - I knew this was the career path I wanted to take. 

It's logical and rational. It's in high-demand. It's a respectable field. It's frustrating at times - but the moment you break through a code and make a program work - it's just about the greatest feeling ever. It takes a lot of perserverence and it's quite the challenge but it's a field that I think will broaden my thinking will continue to skyrocket. 

As much as I want a career in this field, the doubt is still fairly strong. I guess the doubt is within my own self though. We'll see how this goes.
